## Chase's Animal Rescue
#### by Sophia Ladwiniec


### Overview
You will play as a German Shepherd named Chase. Your goal is to complete all the challenges and collet all the animals, once you do this you win. There is no way to lose, hinting at how easy it is to help 
stray and abused animals. Throughout the game the mini challenges require you to use simple keyboard input, click clickable buttons, and use mouse input as well. 

### How it works
To move Chase you your up, down, left, right, arrow keys. For the perspective challenges it will tell you on the page before which keys or mouse input you are supposed to use to complete the challenge. 
To collect an animal simply go up to the animal and touch it. To complete and find a challenge, 4 out of the 5 challenges are embedded when you collect certain animals, the other challenge is on the 
second screen after the shelter where you were participate in a small crossy roads game. 

### Technical Details 
To plan this project I used Adobe Xd to plan out each state and as well what items would take you to which pages.

For this project I used p5.js. I implemented three libraries as well those being the play library, clickable library, and time library. For the play library I implemented it in order to make the mini challenges, allow movement for the main character, and to allow the user to collect the stray animals. For the clickable library I implemented it inorder to allow buttons to be clickable objects and allow for changes of states, specifically to the challenges each will have a start button. For the timer library I used it for 2 of challenges to make it so items would appear every 3 or so seconds. In addition to these three libraries I used arrays, groups, maps, global and local variables, and callback functions.
